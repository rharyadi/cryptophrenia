# Cryptophrenia

## What the fuck is this shit?
Here I'm gonna implement some algorithms from interesting book titled "Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography" by Hoffstein.
The implementation will be in python, from scratch (uh, not really).
I know there are available modules for these stuffs. But my main purpose is to learn how they work.

## Contents
This list of contents will be updated evertime I add new script.
- errorhandler.py: is just a routine of error handling. It's boring to write this over and over again.
- divide.py: simply divides two integers and returns list containing quotient and remainder respectively.
- gcd.py: this script will return gcd(a,b) from given integer a and b.
- exteuclid.py: extended Euclidean algorithm, finds u and v that satisfy au + bv = gcd(a,b)
- fastpower.py: fast powering algorithm using binary expansion
- primechecker.py: checking if a number is a prime using Fermat Little Theorem
- naiveeulerphi.py: computing Euler's Phi function, by bruteforce
